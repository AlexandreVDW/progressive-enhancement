    <h2>The story</h2>
    <p class="first_p">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <em>“Maybe.”</em> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <em>“Maybe.”</em></p>
    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <strong class="bad">Bad</strong>,</q> and the farmer responded, <em>“Maybe.”</em> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, <em>“Maybe.”</em></p>
    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <strong class="good">Good</strong> or <strong class="bad">Bad</strong> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2> 
    <p><strong class="good">good</strong> and <strong class="bad">bad</strong> are just one perspective. Bananas are <strong class="good">good</strong> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <strong class="good">good</strong> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
